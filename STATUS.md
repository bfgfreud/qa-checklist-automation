### ❌ Phase 3: Realtime Infrastructure (SKIPPED)
**Owner**: N/A
**Status**: SKIPPED - Using Smart Polling Instead

**Decision**: No Supabase Realtime subscription (cost optimization)
**Alternative**: Smart polling with React Query (5-10 second intervals)
**Architecture**: See `docs/FRONTEND_UX_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ $0 cost (vs $25+/month for Realtime)
- ✅ 100% free tier compliant
- ✅ Simpler implementation
- ⚠️ 5-10 second latency (acceptable for QA collaboration)

**What We Use Instead**:
- React Query polling (frontend)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### ✅ Latest Stability Fixes (Just Deployed!)

**What was fixed**:
1. ✅ **Notes disappearing mid-typing** - Implemented activity-based timeout with 10-second inactivity check. Local edits are preserved during polling and only cleared after user stops typing for 10+ seconds.
2. ✅ **Test cases jumping after status change** - Changed to immutable update patterns using shallow copying with `.map()` to preserve exact array order. Added scroll position preservation during background polls.
3. ✅ **Security - Cross-tester editing** - All input fields check `isOwnResult` before allowing edits. Other testers' results are read-only.
4. ✅ **Test results creation** - `assignTesterToProject` now creates test result rows for all existing modules when a new tester joins.
5. ✅ **Auto-assignment timing** - Added auto-assign to Edit Mode so it happens BEFORE modules are added.

**Technical Implementation**:
- `localEditsRef` tracks `lastActivity: Date.now()` on every keystroke
- Separate timeout refs for save (`notesTimeoutRef`) and clear (`notesClearTimeoutRef`)
- 1.5s debounce for auto-save, 10s timeout for clearing (only if inactive)
- Scroll position saved before fetch, restored with `requestAnimationFrame` after render
- Immutable updates: `{ ...checklist, modules: checklist.modules.map(...) }`

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/testerService.ts:323-384` - Test result creation on assignment
- `contexts/TesterContext.tsx:43-58` - Exclude Legacy Tester from matching
- `app/projects/[projectId]/edit/page.tsx` - Auto-assign current tester
- `app/projects/[projectId]/work/page.tsx:40-774` - All stability fixes

**Deployed to Production**: https://qa-checklist-automation.vercel.app/

**Testing Required**: User needs to refresh browser and verify:
- ✅ Notes don't disappear while typing long sentences
- ✅ Test cases stay in place after status changes
- ✅ Testers can only edit their own results
- ✅ New projects have proper multi-tester structure

---

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Next)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - ✅ Test multi-tester collaboration (2+ testers)
   - ⏳ Verify all stability fixes work in production
   - Test with large checklists (100+ testcases)
   - Test image upload and deletion at scale
   - Monitor request volume vs. free tier limits

2. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
   - Handle network errors gracefully
   - Test offline/online scenarios
   - Concurrent edit conflict resolution
   - Empty state improvements
   - Better loading states

3. **Polish & UX Improvements**
   - Mobile responsiveness (currently desktop-focused)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S to save, etc.)
   - Better success/error notifications
   - Improved transitions and animations
   - Accessibility improvements

4. **Future Enhancements (Optional)**
   - Drag-drop reordering of modules and testcases
   - Export checklist to PDF/Excel
   - Dashboard with analytics
   - Email notifications
   - UI overhaul for better visual design
